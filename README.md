This Homework was supposed to be a group project, but unfortunately no one in my group worked on it and as a result we didn't even had a good presentation on it and all we had to present was just the small amount of work I finished at that time. After talking to Brian my instructor, I decided to finish it on my own and here it is. It may not be perfect but I finishe a group project on my own.

In order to open it please use terminal too type:

1. npm install
